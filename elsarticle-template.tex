\begin{abstract}
Temporal assignments carry substantive weight in archaeological practice, and it is regularly assumed that artifacts from different temporal units may have differed in ways that convey changes in preference or behaviour. Similarly, archaeologists regularly assume that raw material differences articulate with stone tool morphology, and the role of differential raw material quality and preference associated with Caddo lithic technology remains largely unexplored. Whether a particular artefact is found within or outside of burial contexts is a sensitive and regularly discussed topic in the archaeological literature, providing valuable insights related to prehistoric burial practices, as well as generational shifts in aesthetic, design, and raw material preferences. These assumptions were tested using the tools of geometric morphometrics, yielding results that support the hypothesis that Perdiz arrow point shape is protean, and that significant differences existed in shape by time, raw material choice, and burial context.

The assumption is that the ability to execute formal technological designs is severely limited by the quality of the raw material. Toolkits based on high quality raw materials are thought to be easier to design because fracture is easier to control \citep{RN4315,RN8924}. In contrast, toolkits based on poor quality raw material are more difficult to design because fracture is unpredictable and results in severe, irreparable errors during reduction. Even where low raw material abundance would encourage formal technological design, raw material quality is thought to be the overriding factor constraining lithic technological organization \citep[257]{RN5907}.
\end{quote}

East Texas geologic formations are poor in lithic raw materials \citep[Figure 2.1]{RN439}, or at least knappable lithic raw materials. Consequently, lithic raw materials suitable for the manufacture of Perdiz arrow points would have been a carefully conserved resource for the sedentary aboriginal Caddo populations of east Texas. In the general east Texas area, only the Pisgah Ridge chert in the Trinity River basin, Manning fused glass in the Manning Formation (part of the Jackson group of Eocene age), and various cherts and quartzites in the Catahoula Formation---exposed in the Neches River basin---are in “geological formations that contain in situ rocks suitable for the manufacture of stone tools” \citep[49]{RN439}. Upland stream gravels are relatively widespread throughout parts of East Texas \citep[56-57]{RN439}. High quality and knappable cobbles of chert, novaculite, and quartzite are present in the Red River gravels in northeastern Texas (also the Bowie gravels of the Red-Sulphur River interfluve, per \citet{RN846}), which derive from chert-bearing formations in the Ouachita Mountains of southeastern Oklahoma \citep[Figure 1.20]{RN439}.

According to a study of lithic raw material sources in the Neches River basin \citet[69]{RN1253}, there are redeposited gravels on stream terraces that contain small cobbles and pebbles of petrified wood, fine-grained quartzite, and various cherts. Local cherts tend to be red, gray, tan, and brown in color \cite[66]{RN1253}. Non-local cherts found on sites in the Neches and Angelina river basins are apparently from Central Texas Edwards Plateau sources, and these are lustrous gray, blue-gray, and dark brown in colour.

Local lithic raw materials include coarse- and fine-grained quartzite, petrified or silicifed wood, ferruginous sandstone, jasper, and several varieties of earth-toned cherts: yellowish-brown, gray, red, light brown, brown, greenish-brown, and a reddish-brown colour. Non-local raw materials are white and red novaculite, black chert, dark gray chert, white chert, bluish-gray chert, a yellowish-red chert, and quartz. A distinctive coarse-grained quartzite (or metaquartzite) may occur in this general area, though it probably is restricted to localised sources. The material is described by \citet[67]{RN1253} as being of sugary coarse-grained texture and light gray to yellowish-brown in colour, and may originate in the Glover Sandstone (part of the basal Sparta Sand Formation) in northeastern Houston County \cite[69]{RN1253}. A quarry (41VN39) of grayish-white quartzite is known in the Sabine River basin in Van Zandt County, which has been noted to turn pink when heat-treated \cite{RN1898}).

The most likely contributing source(s) of non-local cherts used for the manufacture of Perdiz arrow points in northeast and east Texas are those from various Edwards Formation localities in central Texas \citep{RN439,RN2145}. These resources occur in a region that encompasses the Edwards Plateau and the southern Llano Estacado and occur in both massive ledge and cobble varieties. Raw materials also occur as significant gravel sources along the Colorado and Brazos River Valleys, but may occur as reworked and lagged members of Uvalde Gravel deposits.

\subsection*{Shape, raw material, and human behaviour}

Perdiz arrow points (\citealp[283 and Plate 142]{RN7795}; \citealp[504 and Plate 131]{RN5769}) occur across most of Texas from the Rio Grande eastward to the Neches River basin, and from the Red River (Texas and Oklahoma) south to the eastern and central parts of the Gulf Coast, and have been noted to include more variation in size and proportions than most arrow point types in Texas. In outline, Perdiz arrow points have a “[t]riangular blade with edges usually quite straight but sometimes slightly convex or concave. Shoulders sometimes at right angles to stem but usually well barbed. Stem contracted, often quite sharp at base, but may be somewhat rounded. Occasionally, specimen may be worked on one face only or mainly on one face…[w]orkmanship generally good, sometimes exceedingly fine with minutely serrated blade edges” \cite[504]{RN5769}. 

Perdiz arrow points fall within what \citet[738-741]{RN5873} referred to as a maintainable tool; however, unlike dart points, the morphological attributes of arrow points—generally small and thin—somewhat limit discussions of optimisation related to planned breakage caused by impact \citep{RN6170,RN7045}, providing for differing expressions of maintainability \citep{RN5789}. The anticipated exploitation of raw material resources, coupled with the perceived technological advantages of using heat treatment \citep{RN6171}, may have resulted in longer and larger flakes (and more of them), provided the temperature of the stone reached the requisite temperature \citep{RN5900}. Thermal properties of locally-available raw materials are ill-understood in the southern Caddo area, and it remains unclear whether Caddo knappers enlisted expedient \citep{RN8970,RN6201}, slow and steady \citep{RN8971}, or hybrid approaches to heat treatment.

Inferences regarding human behaviour drawn from stone tool raw material source use patterns are predicated on accurate knowledge of the location of those sources actually used \citep[365]{RN5787}. Reduction models rooted in knapping experiments make an assumption that the reduction process is known \citep{RN6855}; however, experiments have illustrated that numerous manufacturing strategies could be employed to generate the same products \citep{RN8968,RN8969}. 

\section*{Perdiz arrow point sample}

The Perdiz sample used in this analysis comes from Anderson, Camp, Harrison, Houston, Nacogdoches, San Augustine, Smith, and Shelby counties (map provided in \href{https://aksel-blaise.github.io/perdiz/spatial.html}{supplementary materials}) \citep{RN8980}, and consists of whole/intact Perdiz arrow points from 20 sites across the southern Caddo area, manufactured using chert, quartzite, and silicified wood (Figure ~\ref{fig:raw.mat}a). Raw material distributions differ among sites, and chert was preferred across the greatest geography (Figure ~\ref{fig:raw.mat}a). Use of quartzite was limited to Camp, Harrison, and Houston Counties (Figure ~\ref{fig:raw.mat}a), silicified wood was employed for Perdiz manufacture in Houston, Nacogdoches, and Shelby Counties; however, Washington Square Mound (41NA49) is the only burial context where silicified wood Perdiz points have been recovered (Figure int1:a). All three raw material types are present in Caddo burials, (Figure ~\ref{fig:raw.mat}b); however, raw materials differ in the Middle, Late, and Historic Caddo periods, where chert, quartzite, and silicified wood are present throughout all three periods, but quartzite occurs only in Middle and Late Caddo contexts (Figure ~\ref{fig:raw.mat}c). Radiocarbon and relative dates are discussed in more detail below; however, the median of that temporal range was used to assign the Perdiz points to the appropriate temporal period (Middle Caddo, CE 1200-1450; Late Caddo, CE 1450-1680; and Historic Caddo, CE 1680+) (Figure ~\ref{fig:raw.mat}d).

\subsection*{41AN51, Pace McDonald}

The Pace McDonald site (41AN51) is a prehistoric Caddo mound center and associated settlement in the upper Neches River basin of East Texas that was established and occupied during the Middle Caddo period (CE 1250-1450). Nine Perdiz arrow points from habitation contexts are in the collections from the site, including eight made from non-local chert (primarily Edwards Plateau chert from Central Texas) and one from a local chert \citep{RN2444}.

\subsection*{41AN115}

This multi-component prehistoric site is on Town Creek in the Trinity River basin \citep{RN8982}. Diagnostic projectile points recovered at the site suggest it was occupied from Late Paleoindian times to the Woodland period. There is also a small post-CE 900 ancestral Caddo component marked by three grog-tempered ceramic sherds and one Perdiz point from occupational deposits. The Perdiz point is made from a non-local black chert.

\subsection*{41CP5, Tuck Carpenter}

The Tuck Carpenter site is a well-studied Late Caddo period Titus phase cemetery on Dry Creek in the Big Cypress Creek basin, and was occupied by the Caddo from the 15th to the 17th century. Burials with Perdiz points are the earliest in the cemetery, and likely date from CE 1430-1500 \citep[197]{RN8962}. A single radiocarbon date was obtained from Burial 10: 360 $\pm$ 60 BP. The calibrated age range at 2 sigma is CE 1442-1646, with a median probability of CE 1546 (supplementary materials, and \citet{RN8980}).

Fifty seven Perdiz points have been recovered from burial features at the Tuck Carpenter site \citep{RN8963,RN3158,RN3159}. A second collection from the site includes an additional 18 Perdiz points from 13 burial features manufactured using Ogallala quartzite and local chert gravel sources; including one that was made from a non-local novaculite \citep[Table 2]{RN8962}.

\subsection*{41CP12, Johns}

The Johns site is a Titus phase cemetery in the Prairie Creek valley of the Big Cypress Creek basin. No radiocarbon dates were obtained from the site, but the decorative motifs associated with the ceramic vessels recovered from burials suggest that the cemetery was used from CE 1430-1600 \citep{RN2440}. Forty-eight Perdiz points were recovered from 16 burial features. They were made from local chert, quartzite, and petrified gravel sources (87 percent), non-local sources (10.8 percent, mainly from Red River gravels), and chalcedony (2.2 percent).

\subsection*{41CP20, B. J. Horton}

This ancestral Caddo cemetery in the Big Cypress Creek basin includes at least 19 burials, from which two Perdiz points were recovered \citep[9]{RN2439}. Use of the cemetery by the Caddo occurred primarily between CE 1500-1550 \citep[494]{RN8964}.

\subsection*{41CP220, Kitchen Branch}

The Kitchen Branch site is located on a small tributary to Prairie Creek in the Big Cypress Creek basin. It is a small Titus phase domestic farmstead occupied during the 15th century CE. During archaeological investigations, five Perdiz points were recovered from habitation contexts \citep{RN8964}, which were manufactured from non-local cherts and novaculite \citep[410]{RN8964} likely from Red River gravels.

\subsection*{41CP495, Sam D. Carpenter Bottom}

The Sam D. Carpenter Bottom site rests within an alluvial fan in the Big Cypress Creek valley. It is a single component Late Caddo period Titus phase occupation, likely dating between CE 1500-1550 \citep{RN2275}. Six Perdiz arrow points are in the site collection from habitation contexts, made from local quartzite (16.7 percent), local brown chert (33.3 percent), and non-local cherts (50 percent). The non-local cherts are from the Ouachita Mountains, and include a gray chert and a brownish-black Big Fork chert.

\subsection*{41HS15, Pine Tree Mound Site}

The Pine Tree Mound site is a large Titus phase mound center with associated habitation deposits, family cemeteries, and a large community cemetery \citep{RN5724}. Perdiz arrow points (n = 68) represent 53 percent of the arrow points that could be typed from the site, most (n = 50) from burial contexts and the remainder from habitation deposits. Perdiz points from burial contexts tend to have been made from non-local lithic raw materials, typically chert (42 percent), while none of the non-mortuary Perdiz points are made on non-local raw material \citep[566]{RN5724}.

There are 92 radiocarbon dates available from the Pine Tree Mound site  (\citealp[Table 4.13]{RN5724}; \citealp[Table 2]{RN2944}). Most of the calibrated dates fall between CE 1451-1495 and CE 1397-1429 \citep[Table 3]{RN2944}, but calibrated age ranges suggest that the settlement “was established in the A.D. 1300s and persisted until at least the mid 1600s” \citep[299]{RN5724}.

\subsection*{41HS235, Keasler}

The Keasler site is a Late Caddo Titus phase cemetery on a tributary to Little Cypress Creek \citep{RN8983}. The associated grave goods suggest the cemetery was used by Caddo peoples between CE 1500-1680. The funerary collection from the site includes one Perdiz arrow point made from a local quartzite.

\subsection*{41HS269, C. D. Marsh}

This ancestral Caddo site is on Eight Mile Creek, a southward-flowing tributary of the Sabine River. Habitation deposits here date from CE 1250-1450 \citep{RN1536}, and a single Perdiz point has been recovered from these deposits. This point is made from a non-local grayish-brown chert.

\subsection*{Hickory Creek \#2, Houston County, Texas}

The Hickory Creek \#2 site is on an alluvial rise of Hickory Creek, an eastward-flowing tributary of the Neches River \citep{RN2347}. The site was investigated by the U.S. Forest Service, and has 15th century (Middle Caddo) ancestral Caddo habitation deposits as well as Woodland period deposits. In these deposits are 14 Perdiz arrow points. They are made from local chert (21.4 percent), petrified wood (35.7 percent), local quartzite (35.7 percent), and Glover quartzite (7.1 percent), a non-local raw material that is from the southern Ouachita Mountains and in Red River gravels.

\subsection*{41NA49, Washington Square Mound}

The Washington Square Mound site is located in the Angelina River basin and is a mound center with associated habitation deposits and a cemetery. Excavations in one mound uncovered two shaft tombs with abundant grave goods, but no Perdiz offerings \citep{RN914,RN12}. However, 14 Perdiz points were recovered from a burial feature in the Oak Grove Cemetery portion of the Washington Square Mound site \citep[Figure 77]{RN12}. Another seven Perdiz points came from habitation areas near the main burial mound \citep[Table 14]{RN8963}. Of those, 71 percent are on gray chert of likely central Texas origin, and the remainder were made from local quartzite.

Twelve radiocarbon dates have been obtained from the Washington Square Mound site (\citealp[Table 4]{RN914}; \citealp{RN2944}), indicating use of the site in both Early (CE 900-1250) and Middle Caddo periods (CE 1250-1450). The best dates that can be associated with Perdiz points at the site range from cal. CE 1238-1445.

\subsection*{41NA206, Spradley}

The Spradley site includes late 17th to early 18th century archaeological deposits with European trade goods from habitation deposits in the Bayou La Nana valley in the Angelina River basin \citep{RN8965}. Those habitation deposits, which have no associated radiocarbon dates, contain numerous Perdiz points (n = 31). Approximately 94 percent were manufactured from local silicified wood, quartzite, and gravel cherts, and the remainder are from non-local brownish-gray to translucent gray chert, likely from central Texas raw material sources \citep[Table 7]{RN8965}.

\subsection*{41SA135, Jack Walton}

This site is located on Attoyac Bayou \citep{RN1971}, and is an ancestral Caddo site with habitation deposits of likely Middle Caddo period age (CE 1200-1400). There are no radiocarbon dates from the site. Excavations at the site recovered seven Perdiz points.

\subsection*{41SM55, Bryan Hardy}

The Bryan Hardy site is an ancestral Caddo mound center and settlement on a northern-flowing tributary to the Sabine River \citep{RN3231}. Radiocarbon dates from the site indicates it dates to the Middle Caddo period, between CE 1297-1391. One serrated Perdiz arrow point was found in habitation deposits (House 3) at the site. It was manufactured from a non-local grayish-white chert.

\subsection*{41SM193, Redwine}

The Redwine site (41SM193) site is a Middle Caddo period component located 22 km from the river on a north-flowing tributary (Auburn Creek) of the Sabine River \citep{RN3230}, which includes habitation deposits and a small cemetery. The site has one calibrated date of CE 1300-1454, at 2 sigma, with a median calibrated probability of CE 1356. The 11 Perdiz points from habitation deposits were manufactured on black, brown, and grayish-tan chert as well as Ogallala quartzite \citep[14]{RN3230}. An additional 13 Perdiz arrow points were among the grave goods recovered from two burial features \citep[35]{RN3230}.

\subsection*{41SM195, Wolf}

The Wolf site is an ancestral Caddo site on Auburn Creek, a northern-flowing tributary to the Sabine River. A single 2 sigma calibrated radiocarbon from a feature in habitation deposits here ranges from CE 1315-1440 \citep{RN3220}. Two Perdiz arrow points have been recovered from the site, both made of a local brown chert \citep[4,5,Figure 8]{RN3220}.

\subsection*{41SM442}

CE 900-1200

\subsection*{41SY43, Old Timers'}

The Old Timers site is located in the Sabine River basin, and includes post-CE 1400 Late Caddo habitation deposits concentrated in the northern area of the site. Excavations recovered eight Perdiz points, all with serrated blades and made from cherts, 75 percent local gravel cherts, and an additional 25 percent of gray cherts from non-local raw material sources \citep[77]{RN8966}.

\subsection*{41SY280, Syb’s Site} 

This ancestral Caddo site of the Late Caddo Salt Lick phase is located along the Toledo Bend Reservoir, west of the now inundated Sabine River floodplain \citep[Figure 55]{RN8966}. It has a number of habitation clusters that include daub and fired clay from areas of burned ancestral Caddo house structures. There are no radiocarbon dates from the site, but the decorated ceramic vessel sherds in the collection areas suggest that the site relatively dates to a period beginning at CE 1400 through the late CE 1500s. One Perdiz arrow point was recovered from Area 13 of the site \citep[Table 33]{RN8966}.

\section*{Methods and results}

\subsection*{Chi-squared}

\subsection*{Elliptical Fourier Analysis}

Two-dimensional (2D) images of the Perdiz arrow points from the Turner collection were collected at a 600dpi resolution to produce uncompressed tiff files, and all other images were imported from figures used in articles and technical reports available through the \textit{Index of Texas Archaeology}. Images were masked in Adobe Photoshop 2020 (v. 22.0.1), exported as jpegs, then imported to R \citep{RN8584}, where the Momocs package was used for an elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA) \citep{RN8925}. EFA is a common tool used for the analysis of stone tool shape \citep{RN2805,RN6313,RN5230,RN5225,RN5227,RN8358,RN8967,RN5231,RN7164}, and provides visualisations complementary to traditional descriptions, as well as linear and/or orthogonal metrics. The outline of each projectile was retained, all specimens were normalised to a common centroid, then rescaled using centroid size \citep{RN8923}. 

The \textit{calibrate harmonic power function} was used to identify the number of harmonics necessary to capture Perdiz point shape  \citep{RN8925}, whereby 11 harmonics were retained to achieve 99 percent harmonic power. An exploratory measure (EFA-PCA) was employed to assess variability among time, raw material, and burial context, and the contribution of each PC remains constant throughout the subsequent figures. The principal differences among PC1 occur in blade width, while those of PC2 articulate with stem length (Figure ~\ref{fig:pc.cont}).
